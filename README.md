# Black_holes_binary_mass_distribution_SEVN

In the era of Gravitational Waves detector of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration sensible to 100 Hz, the study of binary compact objects has become of extreme importance, since it can provide a landscape of the parameters space of the progenitor of these phenomena. The subject of our studies are binary black holes obtained by the population synthesis code SEVN [1], which interpolates stellar tracks to deal with stellar evolution, and it also takes into account supernova explosions and binary evolution processes. In particular we aim to understand the importance of the input features of the program in guiding the evolution, and we also try to reproduce the final mass distribution, and some quantities correlated to it. Moreover we aim to define a possible region of the parameters space for which our model prediction could be use as proxy of the SEVN output, cutting the time of computation.
